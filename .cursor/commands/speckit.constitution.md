# Constitution of the ShopSavr™ Project

**Project Name:** ShopSavr™
**Constitution Version:** v1.1.0
**Ratified On:** TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE)
**Last Amended:** 2025-11-11

---

## Principle 1: User-Centric Design

All design decisions MUST prioritize user clarity, speed, and trustworthiness. The primary audience is bargain-focused shoppers with varying tech comfort levels.

**Rationale:** Users expect simplicity, speed, and savings when using a deal finder. Design should remove friction.

---

## Principle 2: Coupon Engine Integrity

Coupon matching and deal sourcing logic MUST be accurate, non-deceptive, and kept up to date. All discounts applied MUST be verified to work at runtime.

**Rationale:** ShopSavr™ succeeds or fails based on user trust in the Smart Deal Engine.

---

## Principle 3: Frictionless Multi-Platform Use

All functionality MUST work across mobile apps (iOS/Android), browser extensions, and responsive landing pages.

**Rationale:** Users shop on many devices. Our system must follow them, not the other way around.

---

## Principle 4: Revenue without Exploitation

We SHALL monetize ethically through in-app tiers, affiliate revenue, and referrals — never data sales or manipulative patterns.

**Rationale:** Trust drives retention. Our growth model must be sustainable *and* user-respecting.

---

## Principle 5: Universal Accessibility

ShopSavr™ MUST provide accessible interfaces for disabled users and international audiences, including multilingual support, screen-reader compatibility, and color-safe themes.

**Rationale:** Discounts should be for everyone. Accessibility is not optional.

---

## Principle 6: Security & Compliance First

User data MUST be encrypted at rest and in transit. Payment integrations SHALL follow PCI and privacy compliance (e.g., GDPR/CCPA).

**Rationale:** We handle sensitive information (emails, payment methods, etc.). Zero compromise.

---

## Principle 7: Instantaneous Gratification

All core actions (applying a coupon, seeing savings, checkout flow) MUST feel immediate. Loading delays SHALL be minimized or masked with engaging feedback.

**Rationale:** Speed = dopamine. Our UX is our competitive edge.

---

## Principle 8: Feedback Loops

Users SHOULD be prompted to rate applied deals, flag broken codes, or upvote savings. Feedback MUST be tied to system improvements.

**Rationale:** Our system improves only if users can report and influence the engine.

---

## Principle 9: Beautiful Efficiency

The interface SHALL combine vibrant aesthetics with clean layout. Whimsical animations are allowed if they don't block core functionality.

**Rationale:** We want ShopSavr to feel fun and futuristic, but never at the cost of usability.

---

## Governance

* **Amendments:** Must be proposed via pull request to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` and approved by the core team with semantic version tagging.
* **Versioning:** Semantic versioning MUST be used for all constitution changes:

  * MAJOR: Removals or redefinitions
  * MINOR: New principles or expansions
  * PATCH: Clarifications or typo-level edits
* **Reviews:** All active contributors MUST review governance annually or during any major version bump.
