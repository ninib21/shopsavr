# ShopSavr Extension Icons

This directory contains the icon files for the ShopSavr browser extension.

## Required Icons

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Guidelines

- Use the ShopSavr brand colors (purple gradient: #667eea to #764ba2)
- Include the shopping bag or savings symbol
- Ensure icons are clear and recognizable at all sizes
- Use PNG format with transparency
- Follow platform-specific design guidelines

## Temporary Placeholder

Until proper icons are created, the extension will use browser default icons.
The manifest.json references these files, so they should be created before publishing.
