### Requirement 3: Pull Request Automation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated pull request reviews and checks so that code quality is maintained and merge processes are streamlined.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is opened THEN the system SHALL automatically request reviews from appropriate code owners
2. WHEN PR changes affect specific components THEN the system SHALL assign reviewers based on CODEOWNERS file
3. WHEN all checks pass and reviews are approved THEN the system SHALL automatically merge the PR
4. WHEN PR conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to resolve simple conflicts
5. WHEN PR is from external contributor THEN the system SHALL require additional security checks
6. WHEN PR modifies critical files THEN the system SHALL require admin approval before merging

### Requirement 4: Release Management Automation

**User Story:** As a release manager, I want automated version management and changelog generation so that releases are consistent and well-documented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commits follow conventional commit format THEN the system SHALL automatically determine version bump type
2. WHEN a release is triggered THEN the system SHALL automatically generate changelog from commit messages
3. WHEN version is bumped THEN the system SHALL automatically update package.json and other version files
4. WHEN release is published THEN the system SHALL automatically create GitHub release with assets
5. WHEN hotfix is needed THEN the system SHALL support automated patch releases from main branch
6. WHEN pre-release is created THEN the system SHALL deploy to staging and notify QA team

### Requirement 5: Code Quality Automation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated code quality checks so that code standards are maintained and security vulnerabilities are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed THEN the system SHALL run ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript checks
2. WHEN security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL run Snyk or similar security scans
3. WHEN code coverage drops below 80% THEN the system SHALL fail the build and require additional tests
4. WHEN duplicate code is detected THEN the system SHALL flag it for refactoring
5. WHEN performance regressions are detected THEN the system SHALL run lighthouse audits and report issues
6. WHEN dependencies are outdated THEN the system SHALL create automated PRs for safe updates

### Requirement 6: Project Management Integration

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want automated synchronization with project boards and milestones so that project progress is tracked accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN issues are created THEN the system SHALL automatically add them to appropriate project boards
2. WHEN pull requests are merged THEN the system SHALL move related issues to "Done" column
3. WHEN milestones are approaching THEN the system SHALL generate progress reports
4. WHEN sprint ends THEN the system SHALL automatically create sprint retrospective issues
5. WHEN blockers are identified THEN the system SHALL escalate to project leads
6. WHEN dependencies between issues exist THEN the system SHALL track and visualize them

### Requirement 7: Notification and Communication

**User Story:** As a team member, I want automated notifications about important project events so that I stay informed without being overwhelmed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critical builds fail THEN the system SHALL notify relevant team members via Slack/Discord
2. WHEN security alerts are triggered THEN the system SHALL immediately notify security team
3. WHEN releases are deployed THEN the system SHALL announce in team channels
4. WHEN code reviews are requested THEN the system SHALL send targeted notifications to reviewers
5. WHEN deadlines are approaching THEN the system SHALL send reminder notifications
6. WHEN system maintenance is scheduled THEN the system SHALL notify all stakeholders

### Requirement 8: Monitoring and Analytics

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want automated collection of development metrics so that I can track team productivity and identify improvement areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development activities occur THEN the system SHALL collect metrics on cycle time, lead time, and throughput
2. WHEN code reviews happen THEN the system SHALL track review time and quality metrics
3. WHEN deployments occur THEN the system SHALL monitor deployment frequency and success rates
4. WHEN issues are resolved THEN the system SHALL track resolution time and customer satisfaction
5. WHEN technical debt accumulates THEN the system SHALL generate reports and recommendations
6. WHEN team velocity changes THEN the system SHALL provide insights and trend analysis

### Requirement 9: Security and Compliance
